### Spices

*   1 tbsp spices mix (Sambhar Masala or Provencal herbs or what you have)

If you don't have Sambhar Masala you can use oregano, black pepper, smoked paprika, basil or a ready-made potato mixture.

## Steps

2.  Spread the slices on a baking sheet, sprinkle with spices, and salt, then sprinkle abundantly with oil.
    
3.  Bake at a temperature of about 180-190 °C for about 30 minutes. If you have foil you can put cover the potatoes with it, and put 220 °C.
