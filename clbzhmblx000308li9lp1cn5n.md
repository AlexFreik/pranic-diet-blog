# Healthy Chocolate

**Carob powder**, obtained from carob fruits, tastes like chocolate but differs favorably from it in that it does not contain caffeine, oxalic acid, phenylethylamine and other harmful substances. **Replaces chocolate** for people with food allergies, pregnant, nursing and children.

## Ingredients

*   250 g cocoa butter
    
*   100 g carob unroasted
    
*   25 g carob fried (weak roasting)
    
*   125 g milk powder
    

## Steps

1.  Melt the cocoa butter.
    
2.  Mix the dry ingredients separately.
    
3.  Gradually pour the melted cocoa butter into the dry ingredients, and mix thoroughly until there are no lumps.
    
4.  Put in the freezer until solidified.
