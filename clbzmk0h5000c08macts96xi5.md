# Oatmeal Pie

## Ingredients

*   1 cup of jaggery (or you can cook without sugar, and add honey later)
    
*   1 cup of fatty greek yogurt
    
*   0.5 cup of butter
    
*   1.5 cups of whole-grain flour
    
*   1.25 cups of express oat flakes
    
*   handful of raisins
    

### Spices

*   1 tsp of soda
    
*   0.75 tsp of salt
    
*   0.5 tsp cinnamon
    
*   1 tsp vanilla sugar (optional)
    

## Steps

1.  Mix everything.
    
2.  Pour on a baking sheet, and bake at 180 °C (356 °F) for 20 minutes.
    

> If you use honey instead of jagger, then after baking, wait until the cake cools down to 40 °C. Honey becomes poisonous at high temperatures.
