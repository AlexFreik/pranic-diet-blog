# Why You Shouldn't Mix Food

*“The body has a phenomenal sense of memory. A single molecule of DNA in your body carries much more memory than your whole brain does. Your DNA remembers the kind of nose your great-grandfather had and puts it on your face. There is a certain aspect of karma called runanu bandha. The body keeps a record of everything that has happened. Runanu bandha happens when there is a certain amount of meeting and mingling between people. Especially when intimacy happens with another body, the runanu bandha is much deeper.*

*Another thing is the type of food you eat. Whenever a little affluence comes, people think they have to eat everything in a single meal. If you go to any affluent dinners, it has become madness. Some time ago I was at an event where someone was very proudly announcing that they have 270 different varieties of food. People take a little of everything and eat. The body gets confused with this kind of food. Once your body gets confused you will go haywire in so many ways. In India, this understanding was always there. Orthodox people never ate more than two or three items in a meal, and those three items were always matched together. The intelligence of the stomach is such that putting various types of stuff in one thing doesn’t gel with it.”*
