## Ingredients

*   1 tsp fennel
    
*   1 pinch of ground ginger
    
*   1 cup boiling water
    
*   2 slices of lemon
    
*   1.5 tsp jaggery (or honey)
    

## Steps

1.  Put fennel and ginger in a glass
    
2.  Pour boiling water and let it brew for 15 minutes.
    
3.  Add lemon and jaggery
    

> If you use honey wait until the tea cools down to 40 degrees. If honey is added to a hot drink, it will lose its useful properties.

You can experiment and brew with lightly fried seeds.
